# Data Formats Overview

KSA uses various file formats for configuration, assets, and state.

Common categories include (but are not limited to):

- **Config files** – human-readable formats such as JSON, YAML, or custom text formats.
- **Meshes and models** – typically imported from DCC tools like Blender via supported formats.
- **Textures** – standard image formats or engine-specific compressed textures.
- **Save files** – persistent state data; may be more complex or binary.

As the game and modding tools evolve, this page should be updated with:

- Exact file extensions
- Example snippets
- Notes about versioning and compatibility
