# Physics and Performance

This page gathers information about how KSA's physics behave and how mods can impact performance.

Ideas to cover:

- Time step, solver characteristics, and precision.
- Limits (e.g. maximum recommended part counts, collider complexity).
- Performance tips for content creators:
  - LODs and mesh density.
  - Texture sizes and compression.
  - Efficient use of particle effects and lights.
