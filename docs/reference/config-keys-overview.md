# Config Keys Overview

This section is the heart of the **reference** part of the wiki: a structured list of configuration keys the game understands.

Suggested structure:

- General config concepts.
- Part-related keys (mass, thrust, resources, etc.).
- Environment-related keys (gravity, atmosphere, etc.).
- Visual/audio-related keys.
- Scripting/plugin-related keys (if applicable).

Each key should ideally have:

- Name
- Type (string, number, enum, etc.)
- Valid range or options
- Default value (if any)
- Example usage
- Version notes
