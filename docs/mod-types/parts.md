# Part Mods

Part mods add or modify physical components used in rockets, spacecraft, or infrastructure.

Topics to cover here:

- How parts are defined in config files.
- How parts reference meshes, colliders, textures, and audio.
- Mass, thrust, ISP, and other physical parameters.
- Attachment points and orientation conventions.
- Best practices for performance and balance.
