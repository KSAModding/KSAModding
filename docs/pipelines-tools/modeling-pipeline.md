# Modeling Pipeline

This page documents a recommended pipeline for creating and importing 3D models into KSA.

Common steps include:

1. Modeling and UV unwrapping in a DCC tool (e.g. Blender).
2. Exporting in a supported format.
3. Converting or importing into the game's asset pipeline.
4. Hooking up meshes, colliders, and materials in configs.
