# Getting Started with KSA Modding

This section gives you a high-level overview of what modding in KSA looks like and what you need before creating your first mod.

## What you can mod

KSA is designed as a **modding-first** game. Over time, it will support (or already supports):

- New or modified **parts** (engines, tanks, structural elements, etc.).
- **Visual changes** such as textures, skyboxes, and effects.
- **Audio** replacements or additions.
- **Gameplay changes**, balancing, and configuration tweaks.
- Potential **scripting/plugins** and deeper integrations.

The details depend on the current game build. Always check the version information on each page.

## Modding workflow (high-level)

Most mods will follow this general pattern:

1. Identify what you want to change or add.
2. Locate the relevant **config files** and **assets**.
3. Create or modify files in a structure the game can load.
4. Test your changes in-game, inspect logs, and iterate.

Later pages go into each of these steps in depth.
