# Installing Tools

This page describes the basic tools you'll likely want when creating mods for KSA.

## Essentials

- A **text editor** (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) for editing config files and scripts.
- A **file archiver/browser** for inspecting game data if needed.
- The **KSA game** itself, installed in a location where you can access its files.

## Nice-to-have tools

Depending on what you're working on, you might want:

- A **3D modeling tool** (e.g. Blender) for parts and environment assets.
- An **image editor** (e.g. GIMP, Krita, Photoshop) for textures.
- Diff/merge tools to compare config files across versions.

Later pages will provide more specific recommendations for each type of content.
