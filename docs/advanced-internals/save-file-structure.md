# Save File Structure

As the save format becomes better understood or documented, this page should describe:

- File locations and naming patterns.
- High-level structure (e.g. JSON, binary blobs, nested sections).
- Key entities: vessels, celestial bodies, missions, player state, etc.
- Versioning within the save format.
