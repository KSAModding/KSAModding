# Reverse Engineering Notes

This section is for **advanced users** interested in understanding KSA internals beyond the officially documented APIs.

Important guidelines:

- Respect the game's EULA and local laws.
- Avoid distributing proprietary game code or assets.
- Focus on **documentation and analysis**, not leaks.

Example topics:

- Observed data structures in memory or save files.
- Hypotheses about how certain systems are implemented.
- Tools and workflows used to inspect or debug behavior.
