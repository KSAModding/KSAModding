# Documentation Style Guide

To keep this wiki consistent and readable, contributors should follow these guidelines.

## General tone

- Be clear and concise.
- Use neutral, technical language.
- Prefer examples and concrete details where possible.

## Structure

- Start pages with a short summary of what they cover.
- Use headings in order (`#`, `##`, `###`, ...) without skipping levels.
- Use bullet points and tables where they improve readability.

## Code and config snippets

- Use fenced code blocks with an appropriate language tag (for syntax highlighting where useful).
- Keep examples minimal but complete enough to be copy-pasteable.
- Indicate which KSA version the example has been tested against.
