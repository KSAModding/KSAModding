# Versioning and Compatibility Policy

KSA is under active development, and modding behavior may change between builds.

This wiki aims to:

- **Label pages** with the KSA build or version they were last verified against.
- Document **breaking changes** between game versions where possible.
- Preserve old information when it remains useful for older builds, while clearly marking it as such.

Contributors are encouraged to:

- Note the game version used when testing examples.
- Update version notes when confirming behavior in newer builds.
- Avoid removing historical information without a good reason.
